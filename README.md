# antenna

I have built the following  15 element Yagi antenna for the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band out of leftover materials in my workshop. The Yagi antenna focuses the RF energy into a narrow beam like the headlights of a car focus the light into one direction. The antenna improves the strength of the received signal the same way as it does during transmission; therefore Wi-Fi links covering larger distances are possible. The antenna elements must have exact dimensions and positions in order to function properly and the  antenna needs to be pointed towards the station, which needs to be contacted.   AP and client mode operations are both possible. After contacting the antenna to a PLANET WL-8310 PCI wireless card in my PC, connections to a distant AP was possible. Connection to this AP was not possible using the factory antenna or USB Wi-Fi adapters from the same location.
